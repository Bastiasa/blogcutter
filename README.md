## ✂️ What is BlogCutter?

**BlogCutter** is an Android application designed to **quickly cut long videos into multiple clips** with a single click.

Its main advantage is a **non-blocking workflow**:  
you can create a new cut immediately while previous cuts are still being processed.

This makes it ideal for fast content creation and repetitive clipping tasks.

- 🔁 Create multiple cuts without waiting  
- 📂 All clips are stored automatically in a folder
